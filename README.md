# Pyrengine

Pyrengine is a web based graphics rendering engine using WebGL2. An extension is also planned to allow a back-end system using a Vulkan based renderer to stream directly to Pyrengine output. The main rendering functions will be in JavaScript with a Python interpreter planned as well.

The goal of Pyrengine is to provide a real-time framework for rendering complex simulations for science and engineering. It is to be used by the [Aether project](https://github.com/alchemy-dev/aether). It will also form the main rendering system for the planned Pyre cross-platform web based game engine that uses [Electron](https://electron.atom.io) for desktop applications and [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com) for mobile applications.
